<em>Hacking is about thinking for yourself. Hacking needs a place for meeting, discussing, testing, proving, questioning, designing, redesigning, engineering, reengineering, searching, researching, hacking, phreaking, brainstorming and understanding.</em>
<p></p>
<em>As our world is getting more and more complex, gaining and sharing knowledge is key to survival. There is a need for open communication and a free, unlimited exchange of ideas and concepts. The Camp is a place to do just that.</em>
